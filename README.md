**Death Forecast Models Based on Political Responses COVID-19**

The intention of the presented project is to explain how restrictions, mobility trends, temperature, demographic and special characteristics of each country affect the spread of Covid-19. In order to achieve this we will try to predict variables such as R0 and excess mortality and afterwards analyze the coefficients of each variable included in the model and see its effect and magnitude.
